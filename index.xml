      <description>Immune Globulin Replacement Therapy (IGRT) in Secondary Immune Deficiency *Background: IGRT is the accepted treatment of choice in the management of (humoral) primary immune deficiency syndromes. Evidence and clinical practice guidelines for IGRT in secondary immune deficiency (SID) syndromes is less well established but evolving. IGRT can be achieved with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) or subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG).
IGRT in SID  In a study on the Benefits of immunoglobulin substitution in primary and secondary immunodeficiencies: Interim analysis of a prospective, long-term non-interventional study (in which 61% of participants had SID confirmed) a positive benefit-risk profile for IVIG in terms of effectiveness, safety, patient satisfaction, and quality of life.</description>

For example, cardiovascular output and total blood volume (primarily plasma volume) normally increase in the first trimester but this can exacerbate cardiovascular stress on a background of chronic organ and vascular damage.</description>
