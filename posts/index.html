<p>*Summary: patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have a higher risk of typical pregnancy complications than those without SCD in addition to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31808864/">complications</a> related to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease.</p>
<h2 id="pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</h2>
<p><em>Cardiovascular, respiratory, hematologic, and endocrine adaptations that normally occur in pregnancy may be particularly challenging in women with SCD. For example, cardiovascular output and total blood volume (primarily plasma volume) normally increase in the first trimester but this can exacerbate cardiovascular stress on a background of chronic organ and vascular damage. Additionally, physiologic respiratory system changes due to progesterone and an enlarging uterus, coupled with increased oxygen demands of the fetus, exacerbate anemia and intraerythrocytic sickling and endothelial dysfunction.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1535370219834305">Placental function</a> may be impacted by red cell sickling, endothelial damage, vascular occlusion, and inflammation, which, in conjunction with anemia, may impact fetal growth. Fetal growth and risk of preterm birth is further limited by the increased risk of preeclampsia.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Increased cellular adhesion &amp; viscosity exacerbate venous thromboembolism risk in SCD patients 1.7-10x general population</li>

<ul>
<li>Peri-partum: compression stockings &amp; lmwh prophylaxis during hospitalizations</li>
<li>Post-partum: depomedroxyprogesterone acetate may reduce painful crises and improve hematological parameters</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preeclampsia</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vaso-occlusive Pain</strong></p>

<p><strong>Medication Changes</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31808864/"><strong>Restricted Fetal Growth</strong></a></p>

<li>Placental insufficiency due to vascular occlusion &amp; endothelial damage, as well as, lower BMI in pregnant women with SCD increases the risk for IUGR (5x &gt; RR), low birth weight, small for gestational age (28-45% liveborn), and prematurity (2x &gt; RR)</li>
<li>Complications: neurodevelopmental delay, poor school performance, metabolic disease, and obesity</li>

<ul>
<li>Simple or exchange transfusion for SCD complications or high maternal or fetal risk &amp; simple transfusion for severe anemia</li>
<li>Safe hemoglobin threshold for lab to screen RBC transfusion orders for pregnant SCD patients: 50 g/dL</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/trf.14611">(ICTMG)</a> recommendations:</li>
<li>For patients without alloantibodies, to reduce the risk of alloimmunization, ABO, D, CcEe, K-matched RBCs are recommended (low quality evidence, weak recommendation)</li>
<li>For patients with clinically significant alloantibody(ies), RBCs antigen negative to the alloantibody present are recommended (low quality evidence, strong recommendation) and CcEe K Fya Fyb Jka Jkb S s-matched RBCs should probably be transfused (low quality evidence, weak recommendation) to reduce the risk of further alloimmunization</li>

<li>CRISPR is a tool that employs programmable RNA-guided DNA targeted by Cas9 to edit genes</li>
<li>This tool has been harnessed to effectively cure some hemoglobinopathies by neutralizing Bcl11a (which mediates the repression of γ-globin, a component of HbF) in autologously collected bone marrow for transplant post-conditioning, resulting in  hematopoietic cells that produce HbF rather than defective HbA</li>
<li>Preclinical data demonstrated increased HbF as a percentage of total hemoglobin after edited cells were differentiated into erythroid cells</li>
<li>Preliminary (human) trial data showed successful transplantation of patients with SCD and transfusion-dependent β-Thalassemia using autologous stem cells treated with CRISPR (transfusion independent at 1 year)</li>
